# This is the main configuration file for the application.

# Secret key
# ~~~~~
# The secret key is used to secure cryptographics functions.
#
# This must be changed for production, but we recommend not changing it in this file.

# See http://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ApplicationSecret for more details.

# The application languages
# ~~~~~
application.langs="en"

# Global object class
# ~~~~~
# Define the Global object class for this application.
# Default to Global in the root package.
# application.global=Global

# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)
# application.router=my.application.Routes

# Database configuration
# ~~~~~
# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
# By convention, the default datasource is named `default`

db.default.driver=org.postgresql.Driver

#db.default.url="jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1/urlapi"
#db.default.user=urlapi_user
#db.default.password="qwerty"

db.default.url="postgres://api:eXpZM3dWUWVscU5YNzlxVFBnS3RvRytLU0xNZlNxZ1hWM1RyZDNtQ3hJaz0K@172.17.0.12:5432/api_production"
#db.default.url=${?DATABASE_URL}
db.default.user=api
db.default.password="api"

# Evolutions
# ~~~~~
# You can disable evolutions if needed
# evolutionplugin=disabled

#applyEvolutions.default=true

# Logger
# ~~~~~
# You can also configure logback (http://logback.qos.ch/),
# by providing an application-logger.xml file in the conf directory.

# Root logger:
logger.root=ERROR

# Logger used by the framework:
logger.play=INFO

# Logger provided to your application:
logger.application=DEBUG
